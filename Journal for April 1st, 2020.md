# Walden as a fluid text 

- Some texts "reveal their fluidities more or less fully than others." 
- Thoreau began writing Walden from 1845-1847, bringing in passages from 1840. 
    - likely returned the manuscript in 1848-49 
- After not selling more than 200 copies, Throeau put Walden on hold.
- Then returned in 1852-54 and made additional (fourth,fifth,and sixth) that basically doubled the length. 
- In 1854 he made a seventh set of revisions, then an eighth and then the final copy. 

*Walden is then published in April, 1854*  
Think of using a "fluid-text" version by encoding the manuscript
