# Things I Learned Today 

- Reading 
* Hyper Reading 
* Close Reading 
   Looking for significant patterns 
* Machine Reading 
   Kind of reading that is weird and strange 
   Using the machine to do it, not what you are using it for 
* Distant Reading 
   Contrast to Close Reading 

- Using Voyant to upload Walden by chapters 
- Clare's survey about Walden 
## Using GREP in GitBash 

* Find Walden.txt file 
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w+\b' walden.txt | wc -l 
    (shows word count of Walden)
* type above without wc -l 
    Lists every word in Walden 
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w+\b' walden.txt | sort -uf | wc -l
        Should see 10801 
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w+\b' walden.txt | sort -uf > walden_words.txt
* type $ grep -E --color=always 'read' walden.txt 
    Will just find that string of letters not just the word read 
* type $ grep -E --color=always '\bread\b' walden.txt 
    Shows only the word read and not the letters together 
* type $ grep -E --color=always '\b(R|r)ead\b|\b(R|r)eaders?\b|\b(R|r)eading\b' walden.txt 
    Shows Readers reading etc. 
* type $ grep -En --color=always '\b(R|r)ead\b|\b(R|r)eaders?\b|\b(R|r)eading\b' walden.txt 
    Shows the line numbers that the words are occurring 
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w{12}\b' walden.txt
    Shows twelve letter words in order 
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w{12}\b' walden.txt | wc -l 
    Gives you the amount (456)
* type $ grep -Eo '\b\w{16,}\b' walden.txt | wc -l
    Shows the number of words longer than 16 letters 
    Without wc -l it shows the actual words 

### What I Learned Today 
- Use grep to find detailed word selections in a given text 
- GitHub is my best friend with finding information 
- Slack Amanda , Clare , David , or Dr. Shact to get help with repository
